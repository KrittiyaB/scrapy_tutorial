# Scrapy Tutorial
A Scrapy bot that I'm using to scrape 'http://books.toscrape.com/' URL for my tutorial on https://letslearnabout.net/tutorial/python-scrapy-tutorial-for-beginners-02-extract-all-the-data/


## Fourth lesson - Your first Scrapy spider | Using Rule and LinkExtractor
- Grab ALL the URLs
- Filter out the ones you don't care about and keep the URLs about books
- As usual, we extract the data and we yield it to json/csv/xml files
